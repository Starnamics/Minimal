	Thank you for using Minimal!
	
	Minimal is currently in development, meaning you may encounter bugs. If you do, please report them to @Starnamics on the Developer Forum
	
	Please follow the instructions below to ensure Minimal works correctly
	
		Step 1) Move the Minimal folder into ReplicatedStorage
		Step 2) Move the Minimal GUI into StarterGui
		Step 3) Move the Minimal Script into ServerScriptStorage (this is what will handle commands)
		Step 4) Configure the Configuration module to your liking
		Step 5) You're all set!
		
	You should not change the name of the Minimal folder and the location of it must be in ReplicatedStorage (changing either of these may result in the script breaking)
		However, if you do want to change these, ensure that all scripts have the name and location of the Minimal folder set to the new one.
		
	
	If you want to add custom commands, please read our Developer Forum post
